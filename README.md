From the Ethical Hacking course TDDE61 at LiU. Flags for the course are individual and therefore not eligible for reuse. 

The structure for this course was that you had a range of 10 ip adresses with the goal to do black box testing on. The aim was to infiltrate these machines and find flags on the systems. No other information was given and was therefore an open style of learning, meaning you had to do all research on tools and methodologies yourself.
